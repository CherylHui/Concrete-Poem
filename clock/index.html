                I listen to the <span id="water">water</span> on nights I drink away<br>
                and the <span id="ghost">sadness</span> becomes so great<br>
                <br>
                I hear it in my clock<br>
                it becomes knobs upon my dressert<br>
                it becomes paper on the floor<br>
                it becomes a shoehorn a laundry ticket <br>
                it becomes cigarette <span id="smoke">smoke</span><br>
                <br>
                <span id ="ascend">climbing</span> a chapel of dark vines. . .<br>
                it matters <span id="little">little</span><br>
                very <span id="little">little</span> <span id="red">love</span> is not so bad<br>
                or very <span id="little">little</span> life <br>
                what counts is waiting on walls<br>
                <br>
                I was born for this<br>
                I was born to hustle roses down the avenues of the <span id="dead">dead.</span><br>
