                I listen to the <span id="water">water</span> on nights I drink away
                and the <span id="ghost">sadness</span> becomes so great
                
                I hear it in my clock
                it becomes knobs upon my dresser
                it becomes paper on the floor
                it becomes a shoehorn a laundry ticket 
                it becomes cigarette <span id="smoke">smoke</span>
                
                climbing a chapel of dark vines. . .
                it matters little
                very little love is not so bad
                or very little life 
                what counts is waiting on walls

                I was born for this
                I was born to hustle roses down the avenues of the <span id="dead">dead.</span>

                
                This network of times which approached one another, forked, broke off, 
                or were unaware of one another for centuries, embraces all possibilites 
                of times. <a href="#" class="dead-link" >We do not exist in the majority of these</a>; 
                in some you exist, <a href="#" class="dead-link" >and not I</a>; in others I, and <a href="#" class="dead-link" >not you</a>; 
                in others, both of us. In the present one, which a favourable fate has granted me, you 
                have arrived at my house; in another, while crossing the garden, you found me dead; in still another, 
                I utter these same words, but <span id="ghost" >I am a mistake, a ghost</span>.
